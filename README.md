:green_heart: Community Coordinator & 2021 Virtual Assistant of the Year @ The Virtual Gurus

I'm a digital creator: I like working on just about anything in digital format! I can design websites, create digital art, work on digital marketing, eCommerce, and more! I'm an extremely self-motivated worker. I'm a creative problem solver that can find a solution for just about anything.

Technically speaking, I have a wide range of skills. I have experience working with the Adobe Creative Suite, as well as digital art programs like ProCreate or Aseprite. I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, as well as working with API. I'm a quick learner that can adapt to any software in a short time.
